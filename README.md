# US Campaign Finance

In the front-end world, **TodoMVC** is a well-known example for comparing JavaScript frameworks by implementing the same to-do app in multiple frameworks. This project seeks to bring a similar concept to data processing and analytics.

We aim to create a standardized set of tasks using the **US Election Campaign Finance Dataset**, enabling users to compare different tools and frameworks for data processing and analysis.
